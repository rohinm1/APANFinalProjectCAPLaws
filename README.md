# APANFinalProjectCAPLaws
The R code, memo, presentation, and Tableau workbook of my analysis of the effects of child access-prevention laws on youth firearm suicide rates from 1999-2019. 

Data collected from the CDC WONDER Database (https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D77) , the ICPSR (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/37363/versions/V1), and the census API. 

The three-page memo is attached as a PDF and the visual aid/presentation is attached as a powerpoint. I would be happy to discuss any of this with anyone interested!

*Moms Demand Action is a **hypothetical** client in this project, but their work is invaluable.
